# DesignPatternsFinal

This is my final for Software Design Principles.
I plan to make a little console app that will read input to fire a gun that will have bullets that can be decorated.

Creational Pattern - Singleton - only one gun can be created
Structural Pattern - Decorator - bullets can be decorated with powerups
Behavioral Pattern - Command - read inputs to "fire" gun

A game I am working on has weapons that can be customized and bullets can do some crazy stuff, I think doing this can help understand a different way to handle it.
